![Amazon Polly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Text--to--Speech-Amazon%20Polly-ff9900?logo=amazonaws&logoColor=white)

A serverless, infrastructure-as-code application that converts text to speech using Amazon Polly, deployed entirely with Terraform.

This project combines the power of AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and Amplify to deliver a modern, full-stack solution — all without manually touching the AWS Console.

## Demo

This app is currently turned off to save on AWS costs,  
but you can still see how it works in the walkthrough video above.

## Architecture

This diagram summarizes the full AWS-powered architecture, built and deployed using Terraform:

## Features

- Converts user input text into `.mp3` audio using Amazon Polly
- Uploads audio to S3 and returns a presigned URL
- Fully managed through reusable Terraform modules
- Frontend hosted with Amplify (static HTML/CSS/JS)
- CORS-safe and ready for production integrations

## How to Deploy Your Own

### Prerequisites
- Terraform CLI installed
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`) or credentials loaded via environment variables


### Steps

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/terraform-text-to-speech-app.git
cd terraform-text-to-speech-app

# Zip your Lambda function
cd lambda
zip function.zip polly_handler.py -r
cd ..

Built by Kev

This project was a Terraform-first rebuild of my original AWS text-to-speech app — now fully modular, reproducible, and cloud-native.
